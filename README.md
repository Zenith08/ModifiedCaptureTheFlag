# Capture the Flag
![Game Start](/docs/ctf-start.png)
This project was created when I was asked to find an existing project and modify it by my grade 12 programming teacher.
Originally found on [*Open Processing*](https://www.openprocessing.org/) this project was a javascript game where two players moved characters around to claim the opponents flag.
My modifications included features such as:
- Translating the original Javascript code to Java.
- A countdown at the start of the game.
- Particles for winning or dying.
- Enhancements to in game collision.
- A map that changes on the fly.
- And more!

Unfortunatly, the upgrades involved using features that Processing.js could not handle, so the project was not able to be put on Open Processing like the original.

### Playing the Game
To play the game, one player uses the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys on the keyboard, while the other uses the arrow keys. 
The goal is to move to the opponents flag and then back to your own "touchdown zone", the gray area at the back of your side. The game is best 3 out of 5 and the map changes at random intervals without warning. If you get stuck, you can still make it out but it's going to be slow.
